# construction-building-script

This is a repository for demo purpose to showcase using python script to automate my daily flow.

Note: the data files here are abstracted and simplified in order to avoid any sensitive data.

To run the script, do "python3 main.py" , you might need to install a couple libraries such as xlsxwriter to run it successfully, you will also need to generate the Email app password for your email to test the email functionality.
